# WILSAC

An event registration website for technical clubs operating within university campus.
We've used JSP for server side programming as it enables the creation of dynamic, platform-independent methods. I created and maintained database using Apache Derby and used JDBC API to access it.
The frontend was designed using simple HTML/CSS and JavaScript embedded within the JSP files itself.
